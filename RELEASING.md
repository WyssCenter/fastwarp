# Releasing FastWarp

## One-time setup

PyPI trusted publishing needs no API token. Register the project as a pending publisher before
the first release (PyPI: *Your account*, *Publishing*, *Add a new pending publisher*):

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| PyPI project name | `fastwarp` |
| Owner | `WyssCenter` |
| Repository name | `fastwarp` |
| Workflow name | `wheels.yml` |
| Environment name | `pypi` |

In GitHub, create the environment `pypi` (*Settings*, *Environments*) before the first tag and
limit its deployment tags to `v*`; an environment that GitHub creates on first use has no
protection. Add a tag ruleset so that only maintainers can create `v*` tags. Add required
reviewers to the environment if a release should need a manual approval. The first successful
upload turns the pending publisher into a normal one.

### Trial upload to TestPyPI

TestPyPI is a separate site with its own account. Register a second pending publisher at
<https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/> with the same values, except the environment
name `testpypi`. In GitHub, create the environment `testpypi` limited to the branch `main`.
Then run the workflow by hand on `main` with the box ticked:
`gh workflow run wheels.yml --ref main -f testpypi=true`. It uploads the version in `Cargo.toml`;
TestPyPI, like PyPI, refuses a version it already has, so bump the version before a second
trial. Install the result with
`pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ fastwarp==<version>`;
without the version, pip takes the highest version from either site and skips pre-releases.

A release candidate (for example `0.1.0-rc.1` in `Cargo.toml`, `0.1.0rc1` on TestPyPI) goes
only through this manual run. Never push a tag for it: a tag publishes to PyPI.

## Release steps

1. Set `version` in `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package]`); the wheel takes its version from
   there. Update `version` in `CITATION.cff` to match; while a release candidate is tried on
   TestPyPI, `CITATION.cff` already names the coming release.
2. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## Unreleased` to `## <version> (<date>)`. The GitHub release
   notes are the section whose heading starts with the tagged version; the release fails if
   there is none. Add a new `## Unreleased` section with the next change.
3. Run the checks from [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and merge to `main` with CI green.
4. Tag and push: `git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>`.

## What the workflow does

`.github/workflows/wheels.yml` runs on the tag `v*`:

1. `build`: one abi3 wheel for each of Linux x86_64, Linux aarch64, macOS arm64, macOS x86_64 and
   Windows x86_64, with a smoke test and the Python tests where the runner allows.
2. `sdist`: `maturin sdist`.
3. `cli`: the standalone program (`cargo build --release --locked -p fastwarp-cli --target
   <triple>`) for the same five platforms, packed as `fastwarp-<triple>.tar.gz` (`.zip` on
   Windows) with `LICENSE`, `NOTICE` and `README.txt`, and a `.sha256` file per archive. Linux
   builds in the pinned manylinux 2.28 image of the wheels (rustup-init checked against a pinned
   SHA-256) and checks that the program needs glibc 2.28 at most and links only the C library,
   `libm`, `libdl`, `libpthread`, `librt` and `libgcc_s` (Vulkan is loaded at run time). macOS
   checks that only system libraries are linked; Windows links the static C runtime and checks
   that no Visual C++ runtime DLL is imported. Each program runs `--version`, `recipe` and
   `gpu-info` (status 0 or 4); the macOS x86_64 program runs only if the runner has Rosetta 2,
   otherwise the job warns. Every leg except macOS x86_64 then installs and uninstalls its archive
   with `scripts/install.sh` or `scripts/install.ps1`, and the macOS arm64 leg runs
   `ci/test-install.sh`.
4. `installers`: after `cli`, checks the `.sha256` files of the archives and writes the version
   of `Cargo.toml` and the SHA-256 of every archive into `scripts/install.sh` and
   `scripts/install.ps1` as `fastwarp-installer.sh` and `fastwarp-installer.ps1`. The installer
   of a release thus installs that release and checks the download against the checksum it
   holds, not against a file next to the archive. On a tag it fails unless the tag equals the
   `Cargo.toml` version.
5. `attest`: build provenance attestations (`actions/attest`) for the wheels, the sdist, the
   archives and the installers. It is the only job with `attestations: write`.
6. `release`: fails unless the tag equals the `Cargo.toml` version, then creates the GitHub
   release as a draft with the wheels, the sdist, the archives with their `.sha256` files, the
   installers and `SHA256SUMS` (every file except the `.sha256` files). The notes are the
   `CHANGELOG.md` section plus a link to the install instructions in `docs/cli.md`.
7. `publish`: after the jobs above succeed, uploads the wheels and the sdist to PyPI
   through OIDC trusted publishing, in the `pypi` environment. Only `attest`, `publish` and
   `publish-testpypi` have `id-token: write`.
8. `publish-release`: after the upload to PyPI succeeds, publishes the drafted GitHub release.
   A failure in any job above leaves the release a draft and PyPI untouched.

If `publish` fails, the GitHub release stays a draft. Fix the cause and use *Re-run failed jobs*
on the same run; files that PyPI already has are skipped. Do not use *Re-run all jobs*:
`release` fails when the draft already exists. A re-run uses the workflow file of the tagged
commit; if the fix is in `wheels.yml`, delete the draft and release the next version.

A PyPI version cannot be replaced once uploaded. If a release is wrong, yank it on PyPI and
release the next version.

`gh workflow run wheels` builds the wheels, the programs and the installers by hand (download
them from the run's artifacts); the `attest`, `release`, `publish` and `publish-release` jobs run
only for a pushed tag, never for a manual run.

The installer scripts are tested on every push (`ci.yml`, job `installers`: ShellCheck,
PSScriptAnalyzer and an end-to-end test of `install.sh` against a fake release) and on ready pull
requests and nightly (`full.yml`, job `installer-windows`: `install.ps1` on Windows PowerShell 5.1
and PowerShell 7). The pinned tools (manylinux image, rustup-init, ShellCheck, PSScriptAnalyzer)
are not updated by Dependabot; update their versions and checksums by hand.

## After the release

Check the project page at <https://pypi.org/project/fastwarp/> and install the wheel in a clean
environment: `python -c "import fastwarp; print(fastwarp.__version__)"`.

Check the standalone program on Linux, macOS and Windows with the installer of the release, as a
user would (see [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md#install)):

```bash
v=<version>
gh release download "v$v" -R WyssCenter/fastwarp -p fastwarp-installer.sh
gh attestation verify fastwarp-installer.sh --repo WyssCenter/fastwarp
sh fastwarp-installer.sh --no-modify-path --dir "$PWD/bin"
bin/fastwarp --version && bin/fastwarp gpu-info
sh fastwarp-installer.sh --uninstall --dir "$PWD/bin"
```

On Windows, the same with `fastwarp-installer.ps1 -NoModifyPath -Dir $PWD\bin` and `-Uninstall`.
`gh attestation verify <file> --repo WyssCenter/fastwarp` checks any file of the release.
