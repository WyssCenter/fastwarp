    """Register ``moving`` onto ``fixed`` on the GPU and write ANTs transform files.

    By default the registration runs a centre-of-mass start, a rigid and an affine stage (Mattes
    mutual information on the first image of each side), then a SyN stage (symmetric normalization,
    the deformable registration of ANTs; neighbourhood cross-correlation on every image), on an
    isotropic grid of ``iso_mm`` millimetres built from the first fixed image. A stage-list
    ``recipe`` can choose another start and other stages.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fixed : ANTsImage, tuple or list
        The image to register onto, or a list of two images (for example a T1-weighted and a
        T2-weighted scan). An image is an ``ANTsImage`` or a tuple
        ``(array, spacing, origin, direction)`` in ITK (LPS) geometry.
    moving : ANTsImage, tuple or list
        The image to register, or a list of as many images as ``fixed``. A second moving image
        must already be aligned to the first one.
    out_prefix : str or os.PathLike
        Prefix of the output files, joined to the file names as text, as in ANTs: ``"out/sub_"``
        gives ``out/sub_Composite.h5``. A string that ends in a path separator, such as
        ``"out/sub/"``, names a folder (a :class:`pathlib.Path` drops the trailing separator). The
        folder is created when it is missing.
    iso_mm : float, default 1.0
        Voxel size of the registration grid, in millimetres. Must be positive.
    write_warped : bool, default False
        Also write ``<out_prefix>_Warped.nii.gz``: the first moving image warped onto the
        registration grid.
    adapter : str, optional
        Use the GPU whose name contains this text (case-insensitive). By default the
        ``FASTWARP_GPU_ADAPTER`` environment variable applies, if set, and otherwise FastWarp
        chooses.
    cancel : CancelToken, optional
        A token that another thread can use to stop the run.
    recipe : dict, optional
        The registration schedule, in one of two forms. The cohort form
        ``{"rigid": {...}, "affine": {...}, "syn": {...}}`` takes the fields :func:`cohort_recipe`
        returns. The stage-list form ``{"initial": ..., "stages": [...]}`` names the start
        (``"com"``, the default; ``"identity"``; a ``pathlib.Path`` or ``{"path": ..., "invert":
        bool}`` to a file with one affine; or ``(parameters, center)``) and the stages (dicts with
        ``"transform"`` set to ``"rigid"``, ``"affine"`` or ``"syn"``: any number of linear stages,
        then at most one SyN stage). Both forms take ``"winsorize"``: ``[lower, upper]``
        quantiles (default ``[0.005, 0.995]``) or ``None`` for a plain rescale to [0, 1]. A stage
        or field left out keeps its default.
    outputs : {"composite", "split", "both"}, default "composite"
        Which transform files to write: the composites ``Composite.h5`` and
        ``InverseComposite.h5`` with ``0GenericAffine.mat``; ANTs' separate files
        ``0GenericAffine.mat``, ``1Warp.nii.gz`` and ``1InverseWarp.nii.gz``; or both. See
        :data:`OUTPUT_LAYOUTS`.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Timings in seconds (``total_s``, ``resample_s``, ``preprocess_s``, ``linear_s``, ``syn_s``,
        ``warp_s``, ``write_s``), the GPU with its graphics API and type (``adapter``), the
        registration grid size (``grid``), one ``(level, grid_size, iterations, converged,
        energy)`` tuple per SyN level (``levels``, empty without SyN), the combined affine
        (``affine_parameters``, ``affine_center``), the start (``initial_parameters``,
        ``initial_center``), one dict per linear stage (``linear_stages``), whether a SyN stage ran
        (``deformable``), the paths written (``files``), ``peak_gpu_bytes``,
        ``memory_budget_bytes`` and the full ``recipe`` that ran.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        An argument or the recipe is invalid. Checked before the GPU is opened.
    GpuUnavailableError
        No usable GPU. Raised before any work, so the caller can run ANTs instead.
    GpuCapacityError
        The stages of the recipe do not fit the GPU's memory. Raised before any work.
    RegistrationCancelled
        ``cancel`` was cancelled. No files are written.
    RegistrationError
        The registration failed, for example on an image with NaN voxels.

    Notes
    -----
    The call releases Python's global interpreter lock while it runs, so other Python threads keep
    running. With the default outputs the files are ``<out_prefix>Composite.h5`` (warps the moving
    image onto the fixed image), ``<out_prefix>InverseComposite.h5`` (the inverse) and
    ``<out_prefix>0GenericAffine.mat`` (the affine part).

    fixed : ANTsImage, tuple or list

        stage : dict, optional
            The schedule: the fields of ``cohort_recipe()["rigid"]``. Fields left out keep their
            defaults.
        initial : tuple, optional
            The start, ``(parameters, center)`` of an affine that maps points of the fixed image to
            points of the moving image: 12 parameters (the 3 x 3 matrix row by row, then the

            Sample the metric only inside the mask: ``mask`` if given, otherwise the session's
            ``fixed_mask``, if any.
        out_prefix : str or os.PathLike, optional
            Write the result as ``<out_prefix>0GenericAffine.mat``. A string ending in a path
            separator names a folder; the folder is created when it is missing.
        cancel : CancelToken, optional
            A token that another thread can use to stop the fit.
        transform : {"rigid", "affine"}, default "rigid"
            Rotation and translation, or also scaling and shearing.
        mask : ANTsImage or tuple, optional
            A fixed-image mask for this fit only, on any grid; its non-zero voxels are inside.

        dict
            ``parameters`` and ``center`` (start and fit combined, what ``0GenericAffine.mat``

    without resampling them, and changes their intensities only when ``winsorize`` is given.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fixed : ANTsImage or tuple
        The image to register onto.
    moving : ANTsImage or tuple
        The image to register.
    fixed_mask : ANTsImage or tuple, optional
        A mask on any grid whose non-zero voxels mark where the metric samples the fixed image, in
        every fit with ``use_mask=True`` that brings no mask of its own.
    winsorize : tuple of float, optional
        ``(lower, upper)`` quantiles, as ``antsRegistration --winsorize-image-intensities``:
        intensities below the lower or above the upper quantile are clipped to it, and the result
        is rescaled to [0, 1]. ``(0.0, 1.0)`` only rescales, which is what ``antsRegistration``
        does without that option. By default the intensities are used as they are; the result can
        then differ slightly from a run with ``(0.0, 1.0)``, because the GPU computes in 32-bit
        floating point.
    adapter : str, optional
        Use the GPU whose name contains this text.

    Returns
    -------
    LinearSession
        The prepared session; use it in a ``with`` block.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        ``winsorize`` is not ``(lower, upper)`` with ``0 <= lower < upper <= 1``, or an image is
        not 3-D.
    GpuUnavailableError
        No usable GPU.
    RegistrationError
        The images cannot be prepared, for example because they have NaN voxels.
