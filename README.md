GPU image registration for Python, packaged as a wheel. FastWarp was developed by
**Richard Köhler** (Wyss Center for Bio and Neuroengineering) and **Jan Philipp Payonk**
(University of Rostock) as the registration engine of Wyss DBS Localizer. It runs a
full Rigid → Affine → SyN normalization in one call, and rigid or affine fits (coregistration,
template alignment, brain-shift refinement) in a session that keeps the image pair on the GPU.

The engine is a port of ANTs/ITK's registration (Mattes mutual information and
cross-correlation metrics, conjugate-gradient linear stages, SyN with Gaussian field
regularisation and field inversion) to GPU compute shaders via [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs). It runs
on **Metal** (macOS), **Vulkan** (Linux, Windows) and **DX12** (Windows), from one wheel per
platform for every Python ≥ 3.11. Outputs are ANTs files (`Composite.h5`,
`InverseComposite.h5`, `0GenericAffine.mat`) that ANTsPy and `antsApplyTransforms` read as is.

Licence: [Apache-2.0](LICENSE). The files ported from ANTs/ITK carry their Apache-2.0 notices
(`NOTICE`, [`docs/THIRD_PARTY_PORTS.md`](docs/THIRD_PARTY_PORTS.md)). Every file states its
licence in an SPDX header or through `REUSE.toml` ([REUSE](https://reuse.software/)).

## Speed

[docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md) describes how FastWarp's speed is measured against
ANTs and how to repeat it: the [benchmark](docs/benchmarks.md) times every registration (Linear,
SyN, total), linear-session fits and the post-processing (`compose_field`, `apply_transforms`)
next to `antsRegistration` and `antsApplyTransforms` on public data, and records the machine and
software. No benchmark results yet.

Earlier measurements on one subject of a non-public cohort, which cannot be repeated from this
repository: T1w + T2w onto the MNI 2009b template (0.5 mm), 1 mm registration grid, default
recipe, a development build before 0.1.0 (internal version 0.4.0); median of three runs, the
engine's own `linear_s` / `syn_s` / `total_s` (2026-11-09):

| Hardware | Linear | SyN | Registration total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NVIDIA RTX A4000 (Linux, Vulkan) | 3.5 s | 6.4 s | 12.4 s |
| Apple M5 Pro (MacBook Pro, Metal) | 4.1 s | 9.4 s | 13.7 s |
| Intel Lunar Lake integrated GPU (Linux laptop, Vulkan) | 3.5 s | 16.4 s | 21.0 s |
| AMD Radeon Pro 5500 XT (Intel iMac, Metal) | 6.1 s | 16.7 s | 23.5 s |
| NVIDIA Quadro K620, 2 GB (Windows Server 2022, Vulkan), T1w only¹ | 10.6 s | 54.7 s | 67.3 s |
| ANTs on 16 CPU threads, same recipe² | | | 1000–1500 s |

The total includes preparing and uploading the images. The A4000 machine was under heavy CPU
load (load average about 110 on 48 cores) during its runs. The earlier linear-session and
post-processing figures, and what is known about them, are in
[docs/performance.md](docs/performance.md#earlier-measurements-on-non-public-data).

¹ 2 GB is too little for T1w + T2w at 1 mm (1.6 GB): the capacity check refuses it up front
(`GpuCapacityError`), so a caller falls back to ANTs. T1w alone needs 1.4 GB and ran only with
`FASTWARP_GPU_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB=1900`, since the default budget keeps 1 GB free for the desktop.

² The ANTs version, command line and machine of this row are not documented.

## Install

From PyPI (wheels for macOS arm64 / x86_64, Linux x86_64 / aarch64, Windows x86_64):

```bash
pip install fastwarp
```

The same wheels are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/WyssCenter/fastwarp/releases).

From source (needs a Rust toolchain; `rust-toolchain.toml` pins the version):

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/WyssCenter/fastwarp.git"
```

## Use

```python
import ants
import fastwarp

fixed = [ants.image_read("tpl_t1.nii"), ants.image_read("tpl_t2.nii")]
moving = [ants.image_read("sub_T1w.nii.gz"), ants.image_read("sub_T2w_in_T1w.nii.gz")]

if fastwarp.fits_gpu(fixed, moving, iso_mm=1.0):
    info = fastwarp.register_syn(fixed, moving, "out/sub_", iso_mm=1.0)
    warped = ants.apply_transforms(fixed[0], moving[0], ["out/sub_Composite.h5"])
    print(info["adapter"], f'{info["total_s"]:.1f} s')
else:
    ...  # no GPU or too little GPU memory: use ANTs
```

- `register_syn(fixed, moving, out_prefix, *, iso_mm=1.0, write_warped=False, adapter=None,
  cancel=None, recipe=None, outputs="composite")`: one image or a list of two (T1w + T2w) on each
  side; images are `ANTsImage`s or `(array, spacing, origin, direction)` tuples in ITK (LPS)
  geometry. Writes `<out_prefix>Composite.h5` (`[Affine, Warp]`), `<out_prefix>InverseComposite.h5`
  (`[InverseWarp, Affine⁻¹]`) and `<out_prefix>0GenericAffine.mat` (a prefix ending in a path
  separator, such as `"out/sub/"`, is a folder, as in ANTs); `outputs="split"` writes ANTs'
  `0GenericAffine.mat`, `1Warp.nii.gz`, `1InverseWarp.nii.gz` instead, `"both"` all of them.
  `recipe` may also name the start and the stages (see [Recipe](#recipe)). Returns timings, the
  registration grid, per-level SyN diagnostics, the affine, the files written and peak GPU
  memory. Releases the GIL.
- `CancelToken()`: pass as `cancel=`, call `.cancel()` from another thread; the run stops at
  the next iteration with `RegistrationCancelled`.
- `compose_field(transforms, reference, out_path, *, compression_level=None, invert=None)`: the
  transforms as one displacement field on `reference`'s grid, the file `antsApplyTransforms
  --compose` writes (`float32`, parallel gzip; `compression_level=0` stores the data as valid gzip
  without compressing it, which suits displacement fields).
- `apply_transforms(moving, reference, transforms, *, interpolation="linear", default_value=0.0,
  invert=None)`: `antsApplyTransforms` with `linear`, `nearestNeighbor` or `lanczosWindowedSinc`;
  returns an `ANTsImage` like `reference` (or an array for a tuple reference). `transforms` is a
  list as `ants.apply_transforms` takes it; `invert` is its `whichtoinvert`, one `bool` per
  transform (`antsApplyTransforms -t [file,1]`), for linear transforms only (a displacement field
  raises `ValueError`; there is no automatic default). Both run on all CPU cores and need no GPU;
  they equal ANTs to `float32` rounding (`tests/test_post.py`).
- `linear_session(fixed, moving, *, fixed_mask=None, winsorize=None, adapter=None)`: linear fits
  of one image pair (Mattes MI, regular sampling, one `Rigid` or `Affine` stage per fit from any
  start), the pair prepared, winsorized and uploaded once and its smoothed copies kept between
  fits, for a multi-start or a rigid fit followed by an affine one.
  `session.register(stage=None, initial=None, use_mask=True, out_prefix=None, *,
  transform="rigid", mask=None)` returns the collapsed affine (`parameters`, `center`) and the
  final MI value; `initial` is `(12 parameters, centre)` of an ITK affine (`None` = centres of
  intensity mass), and the fitted transform starts as the identity centred there, as an ANTs stage
  after `--initial-moving-transform` does; `stage` the fields of `cohort_recipe()["rigid"]`;
  `transform` `"rigid"` or `"affine"`; `mask` a fixed-image mask for this fit (`None` = the
  session's `fixed_mask`; ANTs' moving-image mask has no equivalent); `out_prefix` writes
  `<prefix>0GenericAffine.mat`. Use it in a `with` block. `register_rigid`, `rigid_session` and
  `RigidSession` are deprecated (they warn and will be removed in fastwarp 0.3.0); use
  `linear_session(...).register()`, `linear_session` and `LinearSession`.
- `gpu_available()`, `gpu_info()`, `fits_gpu(fixed, moving=None, iso_mm=, channels=, recipe=)`,
  `iso_grid_dims(img, iso_mm)`.
- Errors: `GpuUnavailableError` and `GpuCapacityError` (checked before any work: fall back to
  ANTs), `RegistrationError`, `RegistrationCancelled`.

### Command line

The package also installs the command `fastwarp` (the same as `python -m fastwarp`), which works
on NIfTI files and runs the same code as the functions above:

```bash
fastwarp register tpl_t1.nii sub_T1w.nii.gz -o out/sub_ --fixed2 tpl_t2.nii \
    --moving2 sub_T2w_in_T1w.nii.gz
fastwarp apply -r tpl_t1.nii -i sub_T1w.nii.gz -o out/sub_in_tpl.nii.gz -t out/sub_Composite.h5
fastwarp bench    # timings on built-in synthetic volumes
```

Unlike `register_syn`, which registers on a 1.0 mm grid unless told otherwise, `fastwarp register`
uses the smallest voxel spacing of the fixed image; `--iso-mm` sets it. Other commands: `linear`,
`compose`, `recipe`, `gpu-info`, `fits`. The exit status tells a script what happened: 0 success,
1 registration failed, 2 invalid arguments, 3 file error, 4 no usable GPU, 5 the grid does not
fit the GPU, 6 cancelled. Reference: [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md).

### Environment

The former `DBSLOC_` names (for example `DBSLOC_GPU_BACKEND` for `FASTWARP_GPU_BACKEND`) are still
read when the `FASTWARP_` name is unset.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_BACKEND` | `vulkan`, `metal`, `dx12` or `auto` (default) |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_ADAPTER` | pick the adapter whose name contains this text |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1` | accept a software adapter (lavapipe, WARP); slow, for tests |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_MEMORY_BUDGET_MB` | override the memory budget of the capacity check |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_WAIT_TIMEOUT_S` | seconds to wait for the GPU before failing (default 300) |

The capacity check uses the device memory the graphics API reports, halved on integrated GPUs
(they share memory with the host, e.g. Apple Silicon).

## Recipe

The schedule is the caller's: `register_syn(..., recipe={"rigid": {...}, "affine": {...},
"syn": {...}})` (the cohort form). The structure:

- centre-of-mass initialisation, then `rigid` and `affine` on Mattes MI over the first channel
  (fields `gradient_step`, `iterations`, `convergence_threshold`, `convergence_window`,
  `shrink_factors`, `smoothing_sigmas`, `sigma_units` (`"vox"` / `"mm"`), `bins`,
  `sampling_percentage`, `seed`; regular sampling),
- then `syn` on CC over every channel (`gradient_step`, `update_field_variance`,
  `total_field_variance`, `cc_radius`, `channel_weights`, and the same schedule fields),
- winsorize `[0.005, 0.995]` (the key `"winsorize"`: `[lower, upper]`, or `None` for ANTs'
  plain rescale to [0, 1] without `--winsorize-image-intensities`), no histogram matching, all on
  an isotropic grid (`iso_mm`) built from the fixed image.

A stage or field left out keeps the dbs-localizer cohort value, which `cohort_recipe(channels)`
returns in full: Rigid and Affine `MI[32 bins, regular 25 %]`, `1000x500x250x100`; SyN
`[0.1, 3, 0]` with `CC[radius 4]` (T1w + T2w: weight 0.5 each), `100x70x50x20`; shrink
`8x4x2x1`, smoothing `3x2x1x0 vox`. An unknown key, a value of the wrong type, mismatched level
counts, or what the GPU kernels do not support (MI bins other than 32, a CC radius above 8) is a
`ValueError` before any work. The result's `"recipe"` is the full recipe that ran.

The stage-list form chooses the start and the stages:

```python
recipe = {
    "initial": "identity",  # "com" (default), a pathlib.Path / {"path": ..., "invert": bool}
                            # to one affine (.mat, .txt), or (parameters, center)
    "stages": [{"transform": "syn", "iterations": [100, 70, 50, 20]}],
    "winsorize": None,
}
```

`stages` holds any number of `{"transform": "rigid" | "affine", ...}` stages followed by at most
one `{"transform": "syn", ...}` stage (SyN alone is allowed; left out: the cohort's three), each
with the fields above. Without a SyN stage `Composite.h5` / `InverseComposite.h5` hold only the
affine, as ANTs writes them. The capacity check covers the chain: a linear-only chain needs far
less GPU memory than one with SyN. `fastwarp register --recipe` reads the same forms as JSON.

## Tests

The commands are under Development below; the same commands with the CI settings, the tests
against real ANTs and the software-GPU runs are in [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md).

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest -rs   # -rs lists every skipped test and its reason
```

## Development

The Python tools (maturin, pytest, ruff; ANTsPy in the `ants` group) are locked in `uv.lock`:

```bash
export UV_PYTHON=3.13   # ANTsPy has no Python 3.14 wheels yet; see below
uv sync --locked --no-install-project --group ants
uv run --no-sync maturin develop --uv --release && uv run --no-sync pytest   # Python tests (skip without a GPU)
PYO3_PYTHON=.venv/bin/python cargo nextest run --locked --workspace --features fastwarp-gpu/dev-tools   # Windows: .venv/Scripts/python.exe
cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --features fastwarp-gpu/dev-tools -- -D warnings
```

Development uses Python 3.14 (`.python-version`). ANTsPy, which the comparisons with ANTs need,
has no 3.14 wheels yet, so work with the `ants` group sets `UV_PYTHON=3.13`, as CI does;
without it a later `uv sync` rebuilds the environment on 3.14 and drops ANTsPy. The lock covers
every Python the wheel supports, 3.11 and later.
`PYO3_PYTHON` is the Python the binding's Rust tests are built against.

`constraint-dependencies = ["scipy>=1.15"]` keeps the resolver from trading SciPy
down to 1.6 (no wheels, open advisories) for a newer NumPy; drop it once ANTsPy's dependencies
resolve to a current SciPy without it.

Test variables (the former `DBSLOC_` names are still read when the `FASTWARP_` name is unset):

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_REQUIRE_ADAPTER=1` | a missing GPU adapter fails the Rust and Python GPU tests instead of skipping them |
| `FASTWARP_REQUIRE_ANTSPY=1` | ANTsPy failing to import fails the Python tests instead of skipping the comparisons with ANTs |
| `WGPU_FORCE_FALLBACK_ADAPTER=1` | select software adapters only (with `FASTWARP_GPU_ALLOW_SOFTWARE=1`) |
| `FASTWARP_ATLAS_INDEX_MAT` | path to an atlas index `.mat` for a `fastwarp-matfile` test; unset skips it, a missing file fails it |
| `FASTWARP_UIPREFS_DIR` | folder of real `.mat` files for an `#[ignore]`d `fastwarp-matfile` test |
| `FASTWARP_REG_AB_DIR` | folder of a real subject (ANTs outputs) for the `#[ignore]`d A/B tests in `fastwarp-gpu` |
| `FASTWARP_REG_PROTO_DIR` | folder of prototype composite transforms for a `fastwarp-reg` test; unset skips it |
| `FASTWARP_REG_ANTS_COMPOSITE` | path of a real ANTs composite `.h5` for a `fastwarp-reg` test; unset skips it |
| `FASTWARP_GPU_BENCH` | enables the `#[ignore]`d GPU benchmarks in `syn_bench` |

The Rust tests that compare the engine with the real ANTs programs (`antsRegistration`,
`antsApplyTransforms`, `N4BiasFieldCorrection`) are `#[ignore]`d. Run them with
`FASTWARP_ANTS_DIR` set to the folder holding ANTs 2.6.5; unset, they skip, and a folder without
the program fails them:

```bash
FASTWARP_ANTS_DIR=/path/to/ants/bin cargo nextest run --locked -p fastwarp-reg --run-ignored only \
  -E 'binary_id(fastwarp-reg::ants_compat) | binary_id(fastwarp-reg::coreg_metric) | binary_id(fastwarp-reg::n4_ants)'
```

CI (`ci.yml`) runs the Rust and Python tests on Linux with Mesa's software Vulkan driver, and
fails when the adapter or ANTsPy is missing. `full.yml` runs the ANTs comparison tests on
non-draft PRs, nightly when main moved and by hand, with the three programs from the official
ANTs 2.6.5 Ubuntu 24.04 release, checked against the SHA256 sums in
`.github/ants-2.6.5-ubuntu-24.04.sha256` and cached. `audit.yml` runs `cargo deny` and `uv audit` when a
lockfile or manifest changes and weekly; Dependabot opens one combined monthly PR. `wheels.yml`
builds all wheels on a `v*` tag (and creates the GitHub release) or by hand
(`gh workflow run wheels`).
Release: bump `version` in `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.package]`; the wheel takes it from there), add a `CHANGELOG.md` section, tag `v<version>`.
