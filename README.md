FastWarp registers 3-D images on the GPU. It runs the rigid, affine and SyN registration of
[ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) on a graphics card and writes the same transform files as
ANTs, so the rest of an ANTs-based pipeline can stay as it is. It is meant for people who build
or run neuroimaging pipelines, for example to normalize brain MRI onto a template.

- A full normalization (centre of mass, Rigid, Affine, SyN) in one call, with one or two
  channels such as T1w + T2w.
- Rigid and affine fits of one image pair, several in a row on images prepared once.
- Resampling and field composition like `antsApplyTransforms`, on the CPU.
- A command line, `fastwarp`, for the same steps on NIfTI files.
- Runs on Vulkan (Linux, Windows), Metal (macOS) and DirectX 12 (Windows) through
  [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs). Before a normalization starts, it checks that a GPU is present and
  has enough memory, so a pipeline can fall back to ANTs.

## Install

```bash
pip install fastwarp
uv add fastwarp
```

The first line is for pip, the second for a uv project (`uv pip install fastwarp` installs into
an existing environment). For the command line alone, `uv tool install fastwarp` installs it and
`uvx fastwarp --help` runs it without installing.
The same wheels are attached to each [GitHub release](https://github.com/WyssCenter/fastwarp/releases).
The command line `fastwarp` also comes as a standalone program without Python, with installer
scripts for Linux, macOS and Windows: see [docs/cli.md](docs/cli.md#install).

Wheels are published for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Apple silicon, Intel) and Windows
(x86_64), for Python 3.11 and later. FastWarp needs NumPy 2.0 or later and a GPU;
[ANTsPy](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy) (`pip install antspyx` or `uv add antspyx`; wheels for
Python 3.11 to 3.13 on Linux x86_64, macOS and Windows) is optional. The command line is new since
0.1.0, which does not have it: until a release includes it, `uvx fastwarp` and
`uv tool install fastwarp` from PyPI do not give it, but
`uvx --from "git+https://github.com/WyssCenter/fastwarp.git" fastwarp --help` runs it from source. See
[Installation](https://fastwarp.readthedocs.io/latest/installation.html) for the
requirements and for building from source.

## Example

Register ANTsPy's `ch2` sample brain onto its MNI template, then warp it with ANTsPy:

```python
import ants
import fastwarp

fixed = ants.image_read(ants.get_ants_data("mni"))
moving = ants.image_read(ants.get_ants_data("ch2"))

if fastwarp.fits_gpu(fixed, moving, iso_mm=1.0):
    info = fastwarp.register_syn(fixed, moving, "out/ch2_to_mni_")
    warped = ants.apply_transforms(fixed, moving, ["out/ch2_to_mni_Composite.h5"])
    print(info["adapter"], f"{info['total_s']:.1f} s")
else:
    print("No GPU, or too little GPU memory: use ANTs instead.")
```

`register_syn` writes `out/ch2_to_mni_Composite.h5`, `InverseComposite.h5` and
`0GenericAffine.mat`, which `antsApplyTransforms`, `antsApplyTransformsToPoints` and ANTsPy read
as they read ANTs' own files.
[Output files](https://fastwarp.readthedocs.io/latest/guide/outputs.html) says which file maps
points or images in which direction.

## Command line

The package also installs the command `fastwarp` (the same as `python -m fastwarp`), which works
on NIfTI files and runs the same code as the Python functions:

```bash
fastwarp register tpl.nii.gz sub.nii.gz -o out/sub_
fastwarp apply -r tpl.nii.gz -i sub.nii.gz -o out/sub_in_tpl.nii.gz -t out/sub_Composite.h5
fastwarp bench
```

`fastwarp bench` times FastWarp on built-in synthetic volumes. Unlike `register_syn`, which
registers on a 1.0 mm grid unless told otherwise, `fastwarp register` uses the smallest voxel
spacing of the fixed image; `--iso-mm` sets it. The exit status tells a script what happened, for
example 4 for no usable GPU and 5 for a grid too large for the GPU. Reference:
[Command line](https://fastwarp.readthedocs.io/latest/cli.html).
