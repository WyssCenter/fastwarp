FastWarp registers 3-D images on the GPU. It runs the rigid, affine and SyN registration of
[ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) on a graphics card and writes the same transform files as
ANTs, so the rest of an ANTs-based pipeline can stay as it is. It is meant for people who build
or run neuroimaging pipelines, for example to normalize brain MRI onto a template.

- A full normalization (centre of mass, Rigid, Affine, SyN) in one call, with one or two
  channels such as T1w + T2w.
- Rigid and affine fits of one image pair, several in a row on images prepared once.
- Resampling and field composition like `antsApplyTransforms`, on the CPU.
- Runs on Vulkan (Linux, Windows), Metal (macOS) and DirectX 12 (Windows) through
  [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs). Before a normalization starts, it checks that a GPU is present and
  has enough memory, so a pipeline can fall back to ANTs.

## Install

```bash
pip install fastwarp
```

Wheels are published for Linux (x86_64, aarch64), macOS (Apple silicon, Intel) and Windows
(x86_64), for Python 3.11 and later. FastWarp needs NumPy 2.0 or later and a GPU;
[ANTsPy](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy) (`pip install antspyx`) is optional. See
[Installation](https://fastwarp.readthedocs.io/latest/installation.html) for the
requirements and for building from source.

## Example

Register ANTsPy's `ch2` sample brain onto its MNI template, then warp it with ANTsPy:

```python
import ants
import fastwarp

fixed = ants.image_read(ants.get_ants_data("mni"))
moving = ants.image_read(ants.get_ants_data("ch2"))

if fastwarp.fits_gpu(fixed, moving, iso_mm=1.0):
    info = fastwarp.register_syn(fixed, moving, "out/ch2_to_mni_")
    warped = ants.apply_transforms(fixed, moving, ["out/ch2_to_mni_Composite.h5"])
    print(info["adapter"], f"{info['total_s']:.1f} s")
else:
    print("No GPU, or too little GPU memory: use ANTs instead.")
```

`register_syn` writes `out/ch2_to_mni_Composite.h5`, `InverseComposite.h5` and
`0GenericAffine.mat`, which `antsApplyTransforms`, `antsApplyTransformsToPoints` and ANTsPy read
as they read ANTs' own files.
[Output files](https://fastwarp.readthedocs.io/latest/guide/outputs.html) says which file maps
points or images in which direction.
