# Citing FastWarp

If you use FastWarp in your work, please cite the software. The citation data are in
[`CITATION.cff`](https://github.com/WyssCenter/fastwarp/blob/main/CITATION.cff) in the
repository; GitHub shows them under *Cite this repository* on the repository page.

```text
Köhler RM, Payonk JP, Neumann WJ. FastWarp: the GPU registration engine of Wyss DBS Localizer.
https://github.com/WyssCenter/fastwarp; 2026.
```

The same text is available in Python as {data}`fastwarp.CITATION`, for method logs:

```python
import fastwarp

print(fastwarp.CITATION, f"Version {fastwarp.__version__}.")
```

As BibTeX, with the version you used:

```bibtex
@software{fastwarp,
