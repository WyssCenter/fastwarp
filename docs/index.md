# FastWarp

**FastWarp registers 3-D images on the GPU.** It runs the rigid, affine and {term}`SyN`
registration of [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs) on a graphics card and writes the same
transform files as ANTs, so the rest of an ANTs-based pipeline can stay as it is.

FastWarp is a Python package with a compiled Rust engine. It is meant for people who build or run
neuroimaging pipelines, for example to normalize brain MRI onto a template, and who use ANTs for
that today.

```

A 7 T scan of one subject of the public [SNSX dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004470)
registered onto the MNI 2009c template with the default settings
([how the figure is made](guide/normalization.md#the-figure-on-the-home-page)).

:::{grid-item-card} What it does
:class-card: sd-shadow-none

- A full normalization in one call: {term}`centre of mass`, Rigid, Affine, then SyN.
- Rigid or affine fits of one image pair, several in a row on images prepared once.
- Resampling and field composition like ANTs' `antsApplyTransforms`, on the CPU.
:::

:::{grid-item-card} What it works with
:class-card: sd-shadow-none

- GPUs through [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs): Vulkan (Linux, Windows), Metal (macOS) and DirectX 12
  (Windows).
- Python 3.11 or later and NumPy 2.0 or later. [ANTsPy](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTsPy) is
  optional.
- Transform files that ANTs and ANTsPy read, such as `Composite.h5`.
:::
::::

```python
import ants
import fastwarp

fixed = ants.image_read(ants.get_ants_data("mni"))
moving = ants.image_read(ants.get_ants_data("ch2"))

info = fastwarp.register_syn(fixed, moving, "out/ch2_to_mni_")
warped = ants.apply_transforms(fixed, moving, ["out/ch2_to_mni_Composite.h5"])
```
