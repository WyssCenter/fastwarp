# User guide

FastWarp has three groups of functions:

- **Registration on the GPU.** {func}`~fastwarp.register_syn` runs a full normalization (Rigid,
  Affine and {term}`SyN`) and writes ANTs transform files. {func}`~fastwarp.linear_session`
  runs rigid or affine fits of one image pair.
- **Resampling on the CPU.** {func}`~fastwarp.apply_transforms` and
  {func}`~fastwarp.compose_field` apply ANTs transform files, like `antsApplyTransforms`.
- **GPU checks.** {func}`~fastwarp.gpu_available`, {func}`~fastwarp.gpu_info` and
  {func}`~fastwarp.fits_gpu` tell, before any work, whether a registration can run on this
  machine.

The same functions are available as the [command line](cli.md) `fastwarp`, which works on NIfTI
files.

The pages use the words of ANTs: the {term}`fixed image` is the reference (for example a
template), and the {term}`moving image` is the one that is aligned to it (for example a
subject's scan). The [glossary](glossary.md) explains the other terms.

## How it works

FastWarp ports the registration code of ANTs and [ITK](https://itk.org), the toolkit ANTs is
built on, to GPU compute shaders that run through [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs). It follows the
methods of these papers and programs:

- **Rigid and affine stages:** {term}`Mattes mutual information` (Mattes et al. 2003) with
  regularly spaced samples, optimized by a conjugate-gradient method with a line search, as
  `antsRegistration` does.
- **Deformable stage:** {term}`SyN` (Avants et al. 2008), with {term}`cross-correlation` in a
  small window, Gaussian smoothing of the deformation, and an inverse computed at each step.
- **Files and conventions:** ITK's transform file formats, its {term}`LPS` coordinates, and the
  ANTs way of naming and chaining transform files.

The engine works on the GPU in 32-bit floating point, where ANTs uses 64-bit numbers on the CPU,
so results agree closely with ANTs but are not identical (see
[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#results-differ-slightly-from-ants)). Before a
normalization starts, FastWarp checks whether a GPU is present and has enough memory, so that a
pipeline can fall back to ANTs when it does not. [Third-party ports](THIRD_PARTY_PORTS.md) lists
every ported ITK and ANTs file.
